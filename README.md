 Simple Counter Program

This is a Simple Counter Program* I created while learning JavaScript and practicing a bit of CSS styling.  
I am currently in the learning process of JavaScript, and this project is part of my practice to understand how JavaScript works with HTML elements, user interactions, and how to apply CSS to style the page.

 ðŸ“‹ Project Description

This program displays a number on the screen and provides buttons to perform different operations:

âœ… Increase Button:* Increases the count by 1.  
âœ… Decrease Button:* Decreases the count by 1.  
âœ… Reset Button:* Resets the count back to 0.  
âœ… Odd Button:* Sets the count to the next odd number.  
âœ… Even Button:* Sets the count to the next even number.

ðŸ§  Learning Purpose

I am learning JavaScript  and how to:

- Use document.getElementById() to select HTML elements.
- Handle click events with .onclick.
- Update the content of elements dynamically.
- Use if...else statements and arithmetic operations.

This project is not meant to be a professional application.  
It is just a practice project to help me understand JavaScript and CSS basics.
